Ecmascript:
-In 1993, Mosaic Developed first web browser with UI.
-In 1994, Lead devs of Mosaic developed a new web browser by founding Netscape (Netscape Navigator- a polished browser)
-In 1995, Netscape founded Scripting language Javascript. At the same time, Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer and they realized that Javascript is changing the web so they reverse engineered the navigator and founded Jscript language.
The tug of war kicked in as developers were not able to develop web apps which were compatible with both browsers. So in 
- In 1996, Netscape submitted Javascript to the Ecmascript.

ECMA-262 is the language specification
EcmaScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
Javascript is basically EcmaScript languat at its core but builds on the top of that.
